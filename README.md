# Pixelite 

A dead simple drawing tool with focus on small pixel images. Drawing pixel by pixel with no ui 
overhead.

I found it hard to draw simple pixel animation and and tiles for simple games in a overwhelming 
GUIs with a lot of Pens and filters an layers and stuff, but without to simple ability to select  
a color, remove a pixel and draw it back on screen.

There are a lot of tools that are designed to do that, but of cause I would know it better ;)
